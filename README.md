# multiTaskApp

idk, some ideia to put some of the applications i build the most while learning programming in just one place.

ps: developed using mobile first design
ps2: big screen not supported yet, for a better experience use mobile compatibility mode on your browser 

project was made by using what i know from web dev, the only resource was a lot documentation and some ideas from stack overflow for some troubles so far
100% english because i thought i could use my english and at end see the mistakes, it was a whole project to pratice some concepts, i still have to back in every line and make it better in the near future if i can undestand each line of course.
